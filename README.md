# Go libFLAC bindings

These bindings allow decoding and encoding of [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/)
format audio data from [Go](http://golang.org/) using the
[libFLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/api/) library.

### Installation

    go get github.com/cocoonlife/goflac

### Status

The code has support for decoding and encoding with various parameters
however it is only quite lightly tested so it is likely that bugs remain.
